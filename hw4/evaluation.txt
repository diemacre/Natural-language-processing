This file contains the response to Question 1:

1.  Evaluate the parser in its current form:
    -What sorts of sentences can it parse?
        It can parse the sentences which their vocabulary is in the loaded gramar file and those that which type of word combinations
        are defined as rules. For example if we create a sentence with words that are defined in the file simple.gr and the type of words combinations are defined
        as rules like: "she steals watermelons from aliens" the program executes succesfully printing the chart with the diferent edges (Successfully parsed!)

    -What types of sentences will it fail to parse?
        It will fail sentence which contain a word that is not defined in the grammar file or if the rule of type of words is not defined.
        For instance, if we execute the program with the simple.gr and the sentence "john loves mary" the program fails
        as the second word of the sentence (KeyError: 'loves') is not defined in the simple.gr file. Also if the
        type of words order are not defined as rules but the words are in the grammar file it will not create the tree (prints nothing) 
        as it happens with the sentence "she was was buckaroo". Two contiguously verb rule is not defined.

    -What improvements to the grammar or parser are required to properly parse common failed sentences?
        The words that failed could be added to the vocabulary and if its a rule error that is not defined it could be added as well. For intance
        conjunctions are not defined and we could add them.
